# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Run This Database Migration NOW

## Why This is Critical
Your sign-up is broken because the database has a foreign key constraint to `auth.users` (from old Supabase Auth) that doesn't exist with Clerk.

## How to Apply the Migration

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `/supabase/migrations/fix_clerk_integration.sql`
4. Click **Run**
5. You should see "Success" message

### Option 2: Using Supabase CLI
```bash
cd ~/Princess
npx supabase db push
```

## What This Migration Does
1. **Removes** the broken foreign key constraint to `auth.users`
2. **Adds** `clerk_user_id` column to track Clerk users
3. **Adds** missing columns for onboarding flow
4. **Creates** indexes for better performance
5. **Updates** existing admin users to not need onboarding

## Test the Fix
After running the migration:

1. **Try signing up with a new email**:
   - Go to http://localhost:5174/auth/signup
   - Create a new account
   - You should be redirected to dashboard or onboarding

2. **Check the console** for any errors
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Look for "Successfully created user in Supabase" message

3. **Verify in Supabase**:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ Table Editor â†’ users
   - You should see the new user with a `clerk_user_id`

## If You Still Have Issues
Check these things:

1. **Clerk Dashboard Settings**:
   - Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
   - Check that email/password authentication is enabled
   - Verify redirect URLs are set correctly

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Make sure `.env.local` has the correct Clerk key
   - Verify Supabase URL and anon key are correct

3. **Browser Console**:
   - Look for specific error messages
   - Check if user is created in Clerk but not Supabase

## Success Indicators
âœ… New users can sign up
âœ… Users are automatically signed in after signup
âœ… Users appear in both Clerk and Supabase
âœ… Existing users can still sign in
âœ… Onboarding redirects work properly
