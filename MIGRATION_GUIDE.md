# Deliverables System Migration Guide

## Overview
This guide documents the critical database schema fixes and migration process for the Princess deliverables system. These changes are required to make the MVP rock-solid and ensure proper connectivity between the application code and database.

## 🚨 Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Database Fields
The following fields were missing from the database but required by the application code:

#### Deliverables Table
- `approved_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - Tracks when deliverable was approved
- `declined_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - Tracks when deliverable was declined  
- `approved_by` (UUID) - User who approved the deliverable
- `declined_by` (UUID) - User who declined the deliverable
- `feedback` (TEXT) - Feedback/reason for decline
- `assigned_to` (UUID) - Team member assigned to the deliverable
- `iteration_history` (JSONB) - Complete history of all feedback rounds

#### Stages Table  
- `deliverable_id` (UUID) - For bidirectional linking with deliverables

#### Deliverable Versions Table
- `declined_date` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - When version was declined
- `declined_by` (UUID) - Who declined the version
- `feedback` (TEXT) - Version-specific feedback

### 2. Architecture Improvements
- **Bidirectional Linking**: Stages and deliverables now properly reference each other
- **Auto-Creation Trigger**: Database trigger automatically creates deliverables when `stage.is_deliverable = true`
- **Status Sync Triggers**: Database triggers keep stage and deliverable statuses in sync
- **Consistency Checks**: Function to identify and fix data inconsistencies

## 📋 Migration Steps

### Step 1: Apply SQL Migration
Run the SQL migration script to add missing fields and create triggers:

```bash
# If using Supabase CLI
supabase db push supabase/migrations/009_deliverables_system_fixes.sql

# Or run directly in Supabase SQL Editor:
# Copy contents of supabase/migrations/009_deliverables_system_fixes.sql
```

### Step 2: Run Data Migration Script
After applying the SQL changes, run the JavaScript migration to fix existing data:

```bash
# Install dependencies if needed
npm install

# Run migration
node scripts/migrate-deliverables-data.js
```

This script will:
- Find all stages with `is_deliverable = true`
- Create missing deliverables
- Link deliverables bidirectionally with stages
- Sync current statuses
- Update approval/decline metadata

### Step 3: Verify Migration
The migration script includes a consistency check that will report:
- Stages missing deliverables
- Orphaned deliverables
- Status mismatches

Review any issues reported and address them manually if needed.

## 🔄 What the Migration Does

### Automatic Features Added
1. **Auto-Creation**: When a stage is marked as `is_deliverable = true`, a deliverable is automatically created
2. **Status Sync**: Changes to stage status automatically update deliverable status and vice versa
3. **Metadata Tracking**: Approval/decline actions now properly track who, when, and why

### Data Cleanup
- Creates deliverables for all existing stages where `is_deliverable = true`
- Links existing deliverables to their stages bidirectionally
- Syncs statuses between stages and deliverables
- Sets approval/decline timestamps based on current status

## 🧪 Testing the Migration

### 1. Test Auto-Creation
```javascript
// Create a new stage with is_deliverable = true
const stage = await Stage.create({
  name: "Test Deliverable Stage",
  is_deliverable: true,
  // ... other fields
});

// Verify deliverable was created
const deliverable = await Deliverable.filter({ stage_id: stage.id });
console.assert(deliverable.length === 1, "Deliverable should be auto-created");
```

### 2. Test Status Sync
```javascript
// Update stage status
await Stage.update(stageId, { status: 'completed' });

// Verify deliverable status updated
const deliverable = await Deliverable.get(deliverableId);
console.assert(deliverable.status === 'approved', "Status should sync");
```

### 3. Test Approval Workflow
```javascript
// Approve a deliverable
await Deliverable.update(deliverableId, {
  status: 'approved',
  approved_by: userId
});

// Verify metadata
const deliverable = await Deliverable.get(deliverableId);
console.assert(deliverable.approved_at !== null, "Should have approval timestamp");
console.assert(deliverable.is_final === true, "Should be marked as final");
```

## 🔍 Consistency Checks

Run this query in Supabase to check data consistency:

```sql
SELECT * FROM check_deliverables_consistency();
```

This will report:
- Missing deliverables for stages with `is_deliverable = true`
- Orphaned deliverables without stage connections
- Status mismatches between stages and deliverables

## ⚠️ Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback the migration:

1. **Rollback SQL Changes**:
```sql
-- Uncomment and run the rollback section at the bottom of:
-- supabase/migrations/009_deliverables_system_fixes.sql
```

2. **Restore Original Data**:
- Restore from backup if available
- Or manually update records to previous state

## 📊 Expected Results

After successful migration:
- ✅ All stages with `is_deliverable = true` have associated deliverables
- ✅ Bidirectional linking established (stage ↔ deliverable)
- ✅ Status synchronization working
- ✅ Approval/decline metadata properly tracked
- ✅ No orphaned deliverables
- ✅ No status mismatches

## 🚀 Next Steps

After migration:
1. Test the complete approval workflow in the app
2. Verify notifications are triggering correctly
3. Check that the client approval dashboard works
4. Test batch approval operations
5. Validate timeline visualization with deliverable stars

## 📝 Code Changes Made

### Files Updated
1. **`src/api/supabaseEntities.js`**
   - Added graceful handling for missing database fields
   - Improved error handling for nullable fields
   - Added logging for debugging

2. **`src/services/automationService.js`**
   - Already handles nullable fields properly
   - Uses retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Comprehensive error handling

### New Files Created
1. **`supabase/migrations/009_deliverables_system_fixes.sql`**
   - Complete SQL migration with all fixes
   - Includes triggers and functions
   - Has rollback script

2. **`scripts/migrate-deliverables-data.js`**
   - JavaScript migration for existing data
   - Colorized console output

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Issues to Monitor
1. **Race Conditions**: Rapid status changes may still cause sync conflicts
   - Mitigation: Retry logic in AutomationService
   - Solution: Using database triggers with skip flags

2. **Performance**: Large numbers of stages may slow down migration
   - Mitigation: Process in batches
   - Solution: Optimize queries with proper indexes

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues during migration:
1. Check the console output for specific error messages
2. Review the consistency check results
3. Check Supabase logs for database errors
4. Ensure environment variables are properly set

## 🔒 Production Deployment

Before deploying to production:
1. **Backup Database**: Create a full backup before migration
2. **Test in Staging**: Run migration on staging environment first
3. **Schedule Downtime**: Migration may take several minutes for large datasets
4. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for errors during and after migration
5. **Verify Functionality**: Test all deliverable operations after migration
