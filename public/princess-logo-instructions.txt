IMPORTANT: Princess Logo Setup
==============================

To complete the logo integration:

1. Save your Princess crown logo PNG image as:
   /Users/eimribar/Princess/public/princess-logo.png

2. The logo should be the exact PNG image with:
   - The crown integrated into the "princess" text
   - Black text on transparent background
   - High resolution for clarity

3. Once the file is in place, the dashboard will automatically display it.

The logo component is configured to:
- Show the PNG logo in the dashboard sidebar
- Display "by Deutsch & Co." underneath
- Keep text-only version for auth/landing pages

Current path expected: /princess-logo.png (in public folder)
