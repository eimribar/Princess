# Princess Project - Current Status

## Last Updated: August 15, 2025

## 🎯 Project Overview
Princess is a sophisticated brand development management platform for Deutsch & Co., managing a complex 104-step branding workflow with real-time progress tracking and collaborative features.

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ React 18 + Vite application setup
- ✅ TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui component library integration
- ✅ Local storage-based data persistence (Base44 SDK replacement)
- ✅ Automatic data initialization system
- ✅ 104-step playbook data with full dependency mapping

### Dashboard Features
- ✅ Visual timeline with 5 phases
- ✅ Circle/star visualization (circles for steps, stars for deliverables)
- ✅ Color-coded status system (gray, yellow, red, green)
- ✅ Interactive stage cards with hover effects
- ✅ Dependency highlighting on hover (purple for dependencies, blue for dependents)
- ✅ Real-time progress calculation
- ✅ Stage sidebar with detailed information
- ✅ Professional management section with status/assignee dropdowns

### Sidebar Components
- ✅ Tabbed interface (Overview, Dependencies, Resources, Activity)
- ✅ Mini dependency map visualization
- ✅ Stage details with formal names and descriptions
- ✅ Comment system with real-time updates
- ✅ Team member assignment with avatars
- ✅ Resource links management
- ✅ Video placeholder for tutorials
- ✅ Activity feed with timestamps

### Data Management
- ✅ Automatic initialization on first load
- ✅ bulkCreate method for batch operations
- ✅ Default team members with avatars
- ✅ Dependency resolution system
- ✅ Stage status management
- ✅ Comment persistence

## 🚧 In Progress

### Visual Timeline Enhancements
- 🔄 Expandable sidebar feature (380px → 600px)
- 🔄 Dependency line connections (removed, needs better implementation)
- 🔄 Phase grouping improvements
- 🔄 Milestone markers

### Stage Management
- 🔄 Cascade status updates for dependent stages
- 🔄 Blocking priority implementation
- 🔄 Resource dependency tracking
- 🔄 Parallel track visualization

## 📋 TODO - High Priority

### Step 1 Completion (Visual Timeline)
1. Add phase headers with better visual separation
2. Implement milestone markers for key deliverables
3. Add progress indicators per phase
4. Create better dependency visualization (without messy lines)
5. Add stage filtering by category/status
6. Implement stage search functionality

### Step 2: Enhanced Interactions
1. Quick actions menu on stage hover
2. Bulk status updates for multiple stages
3. Drag-and-drop stage reordering
4. Timeline zoom controls
5. Print-friendly timeline view

### Step 3: Deliverable Workflow
1. Version control system (V0→V1→V2)
2. Approval workflow UI
3. Feedback collection interface
4. Email notification placeholders
5. Iteration counter display

## 🐛 Known Issues (Fixed)
- ✅ ~~Blank sidebar when clicking stages~~ - Fixed by correcting Select component values
- ✅ ~~Data not persisting~~ - Fixed with localStorage implementation
- ✅ ~~Dependencies not resolving~~ - Fixed with proper ID mapping
- ✅ ~~Toast notifications stacking~~ - Fixed timeout values

## 📊 Technical Debt
1. TypeScript migration needed
2. Component testing implementation
3. Error boundary additions
4. Performance optimization for large datasets
5. Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

## 📁 Key Files Modified Today

### New Files Created
- `/src/api/initializeData.js` - Automatic data seeding system

### Modified Files
- `/src/api/entities.js` - Added bulkCreate method
- `/src/components/dashboard/ProfessionalManagement.jsx` - Fixed Select value issue
- `/src/components/dashboard/StageSidebar.jsx` - Improved error handling
- `/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - Added auto-initialization

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Removed Features
- **Dependency line connections**: Removed due to visual clutter with 104 stages. Replaced with:
  - Mini dependency map in sidebar
  - Hover highlighting for related stages
  - Glow effects for dependencies

### UI Improvements
- Cleaner sidebar with tabbed interface
- Professional management section matching reference design
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Smooth animations with Framer Motion

## 📈 Performance Metrics
- Initial load: ~2 seconds
- Stage click response: Instant
- Data initialization: ~3 seconds (first load only)
- Build size: 688KB (needs optimization)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Today/Tomorrow)
1. Complete phase headers and visual grouping
2. Add stage filtering controls
3. Implement search functionality
4. Add keyboard shortcuts for navigation

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Complete Step 1 visual timeline requirements
2. Add print view capability
3. Implement bulk operations
4. Create onboarding tour

### Medium Term (Next Week)
1. Version control system for deliverables
2. Approval workflow implementation
3. Email notification system design
4. Advanced filtering and views

## 💡 Notes for Next Session
- The sidebar blank page issue was caused by empty string values in Select components
- Data initialization runs automatically if localStorage is empty
- All 104 stages are now properly seeded with dependencies
- The app is stable and ready for continued feature development
