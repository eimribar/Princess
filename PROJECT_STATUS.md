## 🐛 Known Issues
All major issues have been resolved! The application is stable and functional.

### Previously Fixed
- ✅ ~~Blank sidebar when clicking stages~~ - Fixed by correcting Select component values
- ✅ ~~Data not persisting~~ - Fixed with localStorage implementation
- ✅ ~~Dependencies not resolving~~ - Fixed with proper ID mapping

- ✅ ~~Tab density in sidebar~~ - Simplified from 4 tabs to 2
- ✅ ~~Cannot explore locked stages~~ - Now viewable with proper restrictions

## 📊 Technical Debt
1. TypeScript migration needed
2. Component testing implementation
3. Error boundary additions
4. Performance optimization for large datasets
5. Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
