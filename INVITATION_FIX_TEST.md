# Testing the Fixed Invitation Flow

## What Was Fixed
We replaced the custom sign-up form with Clerk's official SignUp component to properly handle invitations.

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Created `/src/pages/auth/InvitationSignUp.jsx` - Uses Clerk's SignUp component
2. ✅ Updated route in `App.jsx` - No AuthGuard wrapper that was causing redirects
3. ✅ Added safety check in `Dashboard.jsx` - Redirects to onboarding if needed
4. ✅ Fixed `SignUp.jsx` - Now redirects to `/onboarding` after sign-up

## Testing Steps

### 1. Clear Previous Test Data
If you tested with `emberskestrel@proton.me`, you may want to:
- Delete that user from Supabase users table
- Revoke any pending invitations in Clerk Dashboard

### 2. Send New Invitation
1. Log in as admin (imri@webloom.ai)
2. Go to Team page
3. Click "Invite Team Member"
4. Use a new test email
5. Select role (Client or Agency)
6. Send invitation

### 3. Accept Invitation
1. Check email for invitation from Clerk
2. Click the invitation link
3. You should see **Clerk's official sign-up form** (not our custom one)
4. The form should look like the regular sign-up page with:
   - Email already filled in
   - Fields for First Name, Last Name
   - Password field
   - Proper Clerk branding/styling

### 4. Complete Sign-Up
1. Fill in your name and password
2. Submit the form
3. **You should be redirected to `/onboarding`** ✅

### 5. Complete Onboarding
1. Go through the onboarding steps
2. Upload profile picture (optional)
3. Add professional info
4. Complete the process
5. You'll then be redirected to dashboard

## Expected Flow:
```
Invitation Email → Click Link → Clerk Sign-Up Form → Submit → /onboarding → Complete → /dashboard
```

## Verification Checklist:
- [ ] Invitation link works
- [ ] Shows Clerk's SignUp component (not custom form)
- [ ] After sign-up → Goes to `/onboarding` (NOT dashboard)
- [ ] User data has `needs_onboarding: true` in database
- [ ] After onboarding → Goes to dashboard
- [ ] Role and metadata properly transferred

## If Something Goes Wrong:

### Still going to dashboard?
Check browser console for:
```javascript
// Should see this log:
"User needs onboarding, redirecting..."
```

### Check user data:
```javascript
const { supabase } = await import('/src/lib/supabase.js')
const { data } = await supabase.from('users').select('*').eq('email', 'your-test-email').single()
console.log('needs_onboarding:', data?.needs_onboarding)
```

## Success Criteria:
✅ Uses Clerk's official sign-up UI
✅ Properly handles invitation ticket
✅ Redirects to onboarding after sign-up
✅ No custom form code to maintain
✅ Consistent with rest of auth flow
