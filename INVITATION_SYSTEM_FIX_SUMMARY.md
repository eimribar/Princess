- Better error handling

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migrations
Run these in your Supabase SQL Editor in order:

1. First, run `020_invitation_system_complete_fix.sql`
2. Then run `021_fix_existing_broken_users.sql` 
3. Finally run `TEST_INVITATION_FLOW.sql` to get test invitation links

### Step 2: Deploy Edge Function
```bash
# From the project root
cd supabase/functions/send-invitation
supabase functions deploy send-invitation
```

### Step 3: Test the Flow
1. Copy a test invitation URL from the SQL output
2. Open in incognito window
3. Accept invitation and set password
4. Verify auto-login and redirect to onboarding
5. Log out and log back in to verify password works

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Email Service (Optional)
Add to Edge Function environment variables:
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Your Resend API key for sending real emails

### Invitation-Only Signups (Optional)
To enforce that ONLY invited users can sign up:
- Uncomment lines 127-130 in `020_invitation_system_complete_fix.sql`
- Re-run the migration

### Email Confirmation
In Supabase Dashboard:
- Go to Authentication > Providers > Email
- Keep "Confirm email" OFF (invited users are auto-confirmed)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Check User Status
```sql
-- See all users and their status
SELECT email, 
       CASE WHEN encrypted_password IS NULL THEN '❌ NO PASSWORD' 
            ELSE '✅ HAS PASSWORD' END as pwd,
       CASE WHEN email_confirmed_at IS NULL THEN '❌ NOT CONFIRMED'
            ELSE '✅ CONFIRMED' END as confirmed
FROM auth.users
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Check Invitations
```sql
-- See all pending invitations
SELECT email, role, 
       'http://localhost:5174/welcome/' || token as invitation_url
FROM invitations
WHERE status = 'pending' AND expires_at > NOW();
```

### Fix Broken Users
Users without passwords need to use their invitation link to set a password.
Run `021_fix_existing_broken_users.sql` to regenerate invitations for them.

## ✨ Benefits of New System

1. **No more passwordless users** - Users are created with passwords from the start
2. **No email confirmation loops** - Invited users bypass email confirmation
3. **Clean, simple flow** - No complex workarounds or hacks
4. **Production ready** - Secure, scalable, and maintainable
5. **Works with rate limits** - Falls back to manual link sharing

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ Run the migrations in order
2. ✅ Test with the generated test invitations
3. ✅ Deploy Edge Function to production when ready
4. ✅ Configure email service (optional)
5. ✅ Enable invitation-only signups (optional)

## 📝 Notes

- The system now properly handles both new and existing users
- Invitations can be re-sent to the same email (updates existing invitation)
- Users created via old `inviteUserByEmail` method need to use invitation link to set password
- All email confirmations have been fixed for existing users
