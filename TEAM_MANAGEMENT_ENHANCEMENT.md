## üöÄ How It Works

### Invitation Flow:
1. Admin/Agency clicks "Invite Team Member"
2. Enters multiple emails (comma/line separated)
3. Previews email that will be sent
4. Creates invitations in Supabase
5. Generates unique welcome links
6. Invitee receives beautiful welcome page
7. Accepts and creates account

### Agency Pool Management:
1. All Deutschco employees added to agency_pool
2. Shows availability percentage (0-100%)
3. Can be assigned to multiple projects
4. Tracks allocation across projects
5. Prevents over-allocation
6. Auto-creates team_member entry

## üìù Next Steps to Complete

### Remaining Tasks:
1. **Create Onboarding.jsx component** - First-time user tour
2. **Build AgencyPoolManager component** - Drag-drop assignment UI
3. **Update Team.jsx** - Split view for pool vs project teams
4. **Test client isolation** - Verify clients only see their team

### To Configure in Supabase:
1. Run migration: `002_team_management_enhancement.sql`
2. Set up email service (SendGrid/Resend)
3. Create Edge Function for sending emails
4. Test invitation flow end-to-end

## üé® Design Decisions

### Why Tabbed Interface?
- Clear progression through invitation process
- Ability to review before sending
- Success state shows all created links
- Better for batch operations

### Why Separate Welcome Page?
- First impression matters
- Sets expectations before signup
- Shows value immediately
- Creates excitement with animations

### Why Agency Pool?
- Central resource management
- Prevents double-booking
- Easy to see who's available
- Scalable for large teams

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Key Components:
```javascript
// Enhanced invitation dialog with preview
<InviteTeamMemberDialog 
  open={open}
  onOpenChange={setOpen}
  projectId={currentProject?.id}
/>

// Welcome page with confetti
<Welcome />  // Route: /welcome/:token

// Agency pool assignment (coming next)
<AgencyPoolManager />
```

### Database Functions:
```sql
-- Check availability
SELECT * FROM get_available_agency_members(project_id);

-- Assign to project
SELECT assign_to_project(pool_member_id, project_id, allocation);

-- Check workload
SELECT * FROM agency_member_workload;
```

## üìä Success Metrics

### What We're Measuring:
- Invitation accept rate (target: >95%)
- Time to accept invitation (target: <24 hours)
- Onboarding completion rate (target: >90%)
- Time to first action (target: <5 minutes)

### User Feedback Expected:
- "Wow, this looks professional!"

- "I knew exactly what to expect"
- "The welcome page got me excited"
