# üü¢ CLIENT FAQs

### Q: What exactly do I need to do as a client?
**A:** Your main responsibilities:
1. Review deliverables when submitted
2. Approve or request changes
3. Provide feedback within 48 hours
4. Make final decisions on creative work

### Q: How often should I check the platform?
**A:** Daily is ideal, but at minimum:
- Check when you receive email notifications
- Look for the red notification badge
- Review the "Action Required" widget
- Respond within 48 hours to keep project on track

### Q: What does "Approval is final" mean?
**A:** Once you click "Approve" on a deliverable:
- It's marked as complete
- The team moves to next stages
- No further revisions without additional cost
- The deliverable moves to your Brand Assets

**Tip**: Gather all stakeholder feedback BEFORE approving.

### Q: How many times can I request changes?
**A:** Typically 3 rounds of revisions per deliverable:
- V1: Initial submission
- V2: After first feedback
- V3: Final revision

After 3 rounds, additional changes may be considered "out of scope" and incur extra costs.

### Q: Can I change my mind after approving?
**A:** Technically no - approval triggers next phases and resource allocation. However:
- Minor tweaks might be possible (ask your PM)
- Major changes will be "out of scope" work
- New charges may apply
- Timeline will be affected

### Q: Why can't I edit stages directly?
**A:** Stages are managed by the agency team because:
- They affect multiple dependencies
- Timeline impacts need professional assessment
- Resource allocation must be coordinated
- Quality control is maintained

### Q: How do I know what needs my attention?
**A:** Look for these indicators:
- **Red notification badge** (number shows count)
- **"Action Required" box** on dashboard
- **Yellow badges** on deliverables
- **Email notifications** (check spam folder)

### Q: Can I give access to my team?
**A:** Yes! Ask your project manager to:
- Add team members (unlimited viewers)
- Designate decision makers (max 2)
- Set notification preferences for each

### Q: What's the difference between comments and feedback?
**A:** 
- **Comments**: Informal discussion, questions, clarifications
- **Feedback**: Formal revision requests on deliverables

### Q: Can I download files before they're approved?
**A:** Yes! You can preview and download at any stage:
- During review (watermarked)
- After feedback (previous versions)
- After approval (final files)

### Q: How do I share assets with my team?
**A:** Three ways:
1. Add them as users (they get login)
2. Download and share files directly
3. Use public share link (no login needed)

### Q: What if I'm going on vacation?
**A:** Before leaving:
1. Designate a backup decision maker
2. Set out-of-office in your profile
3. Inform your project manager
4. Approve pending items if possible

### Q: Why do some stages take longer than others?
**A:** Different stages require:
- Research: Data gathering and analysis
- Strategy: Planning and documentation
- Creative: Design and iteration
- Production: Final file preparation

Complex stages naturally take more time.
